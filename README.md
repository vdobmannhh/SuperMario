## **Super Mario Bros** in **VR** - a project by Vanessa Dobmann, Rico Gdanietz und Nicolas Eiff

The game is made with Unity, all graphics used are made by ourselves via Maya and Blender

# **Instructions:**

Complete the level by jumping over obstacles such as Tubes, Stairs and Goombas to reach the flag pole.
You have 3 lifes. You can gain lifes by collecting coins and the 1 Up mushroom out of the item box in the level.
You can make yourself bigger by collecting the red mushroom out of an item box which will give you a temporary additional life in the level so you dont instantly die when hitting a goomba.
If you die the level will restart and you lose a life. Once you lost all your lifes you will be taken back to the main menu.
You can adjust settings in the options menu (in Main Menu).

# **Controls:**
